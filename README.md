About the Game


The object of the game is to destroy all the ships and move onto the next round, as the rounds progress, the ships move faster, making it harder to eliminate them. Press 'q' to quit.


The rest of the code is properly commented and self explanatory. Tweaks can be made to change the play style or visuals of the game.
